# semester-project-noroff
This project was for us to help a client, a museum of natural history called the Community Science Museum that was going to open in the town soon and wanted us to make a website The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum.

# What is the project purpose
For this project, we were given a list of what the client wanted the website to achieve. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent, The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents, Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. For this project, I used HTML and CSS again for consistency reasons for what we have learned this semester. I have done a better job of making the HTML compared to the last assignment but I still needed to work on that, CSS was better but I have not gotten a full grip on that due to understanding the responsiveness of the website. I had a panic  when it came to the weekend delivery date, first I had forgotten to put my GitHub repo on public instead I had it on private which would be a problem for teachers to see the repo since only people that were added in the repo could see in private but it was a quick fix that. The other problem is that I had forgotten to make the mobile format for the site so I was awake the whole night til 5 am making that so I had it done on Sunday.
